# Pipe grouping syntax!

### Intro
# What happens here is how a pipe determines how different inputs are grouped when they are processed by pipes.
# In many pipes "grouping" makes no difference, pipes such as "convert" or "translate" simply act on each individual input regardless of how they are grouped.

# There are, however, some pipes where it does make a difference. Take for example the "join" pipe:

#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] -> join s=", "
# Output: alpha ‚Üí alpha, beta, gamma, delta
#         beta
#         gamma
#         delta

#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] -> (2) join s=", "
# Output: alpha ‚Üí alpha, beta
#         beta  ‚Üí gamma, delta
#         gamma
#         delta

# The number of inputs it receives at once determine what its output looks like, and even how many outputs it produces!
# The other situation where group modes matter is when applying multiple pipes in parallel, like so:

#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] > (1) convert [fraktur|fullwidth]
# Output: ùîûùî©ùî≠ùî•ùîû
#         ÔΩÇÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩÅ
#         ùî§ùîûùî™ùî™ùîû
#         ÔΩÑÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩîÔΩÅ

# The (1) tells the script to split the values into groups of 1 item each. Each of these groups of size 1 are then *alternately*
# fed into "convert fraktur" and "convert fullwidth", as you can see from the output. This should make the utility of grouping clear.
# Note: If we don't put the (1) there, it will assume the default group mode /1, which simply puts all values into one group and applies it
# to the first pipe of the parallel pipes, leaving the other pipe unused (e.g. in the example, all inputs would be converted to fraktur lettering.)


### Some quick syntax examples:

#   >>> {foo} > (2) bar
# Means: Fetch output produced by the source named "foo" (which could be any number of strings) and feed it into the "bar" pipe in groups of 2.

# e.g. >>> {words n=4} > (2) join s=" AND "
# Might produce the following 2 rows of output: "trousers AND presbyterian", "lettuce's AND africanism"

#   >>> {foo} > (2) [bar|tox]
# Means: Fetch output from the source "foo", split it into groups of 2, feed the first group into "bar", the second into "tox", third into "bar", and so on.

# e.g. >>> {words n=4} > (2) [join s=" AND " | join s=" OR "]
# Might produce the 2 rows of output: "derides AND clambered", "swatting OR quays"

#   >>> {foo} > *(2) [bar|tox]
# Means: Fetch output from source "foo", split it in groups of 2, feed each group individually into "bar", and then feed each group into "tox".

# e.g. >>> {words n=4} > *(2) [join s=" AND " | join s=" OR "]
# Might produce these 4 outputs: "horseflies AND retool", "horseflies OR retool", "possum AND ducts", "possum OR ducts"


### All syntax rules:

## Multiply option:
# Given by adding an asterisk* before the group mode:
#   >>> {source} > * $$$$ [pipe1|pipe2|...]
# (With $$$$ representing a group mode)
# *Each* group of input is fed into *each* of the simultaneous pipes (pipe1, pipe2, etc)
# Resulting in (number of groups) √ó (number of simultaneous pipes) pipe applications total, which is usually a lot.

## Strict option:
# Given by adding an exclamation mark after the group mode!
#   >>> {source} > $$$$ ! [pipe1|pipe2|...]
# (With $$$$ representing a group mode)
# This option tells the group mode to simply throw away input values that don't "fit".
# What it specifically throws away (if anything) depends on the type of group mode and the values it's grouping.

## Default grouping:
#   >>> {source} > [pipe1|pipe2|...|pipex]
# Feeds all input to pipe1 as a single group, ignoring pipe2 through pipex.
# Identical to Divide grouping with $n as 1, i.e. "/1".
#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] > convert [fraktur|fullwidth]
# Output: ùîûùî©ùî≠ùî•ùîû
#         ùîüùî¢ùî±ùîû
#         ùî§ùîûùî™ùî™ùîû
#         ùî°ùî¢ùî©ùî±ùîû

## Normal grouping:
#   >>> {source} > ($n) [pipe1|pipe2|...|pipex]
# Groups the first $n inputs and feeds them to pipe1, the second $n inputs to pipe2, ..., the x+1th group of $n inputs to pipe1 again, etc.
# If the number of inputs doesn't divide by $n:
#   ‚Ä¢ If the strict option is given: It will throw away the remaining less-than-$n items.
#   ‚Ä¢ If $n starts with a '0': It will pad out the last group with empty strings to make $n items.
#   ‚Ä¢ Otherwise: The last group will simply contain less than $n items.
#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] > (3) convert [fraktur|fullwidth]
# Output: ùîûùî©ùî≠ùî•ùîû
#         ùîüùî¢ùî±ùîû
#         ùî§ùîûùî™ùî™ùîû
#         ÔΩÑÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩîÔΩÅ

## Divide grouping:
#   >>> {source} > /$n [pipe1|pipe2|...|pipex]
# Splits the input into $n equally sized* groups of sequential inputs, and feeds the first group into pipe1, second into pipe2, etc.
# Call $m the number of inputs to be grouped. In case $m is not divisible by $n:
#   ‚Ä¢ If the strict option is given: Input is split into groups of floor($m/$n), throwing away extraneous items.
#   ‚Ä¢ If $n starts with '0': Input is split into groups of ceil($m/$n), and the last group is padded out with empty strings.
#   ‚Ä¢ If $n doesn't start with '0': Input is split into groups of ceil($m/$n), except the last groups which may contain less items or even be empty.
#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] > /2 convert [fraktur|fullwidth]
# Output: ùîûùî©ùî≠ùî•ùîû
#         ùîüùî¢ùî±ùîû
#         ÔΩáÔΩÅÔΩçÔΩçÔΩÅ
#         ÔΩÑÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩîÔΩÅ

## Modulo grouping:
#   >>> {source} > %$n [pipe1|pipe2|...|pipex]
# Splits the input into $n equally sized* groups of inputs that have the same index modulo $n.
# Behaves identical to Divide grouping otherwise, including $n starting with '0' to pad each group out to equal size and strictness.
#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] > %2 convert [fraktur|fullwidth]
# Output: ùîûùî©ùî≠ùî•ùîû
#         ùî§ùîûùî™ùî™ùîû
#         ÔΩÇÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩÅ
#         ÔΩÑÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩîÔΩÅ

## Interval grouping:
#   >>> {source} > #$i..$j [pipe1|pipe2|...]
# Groups inputs from index $i up to (not including) index $j as one group and applies them to pipe1, the other pipes are never used.
# If the strict option is given, the items outside the selected range are thrown away, otherwise they are left in place, unaffected.
# $i and $j can be negative, and follows python's negative index logic for those. (e.g. a[-1] == a[len(a)-1])
# $i and $j may also use '-0' to indicate the last position in the string. (i.e. '-0' -> len(inputs))
#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] > #1..3 convert fullwidth
# Output: alpha
#         ÔΩÇÔΩÖÔΩîÔΩÅ
#         ÔΩáÔΩÅÔΩçÔΩçÔΩÅ
#         delta

## Index grouping:
#   >>> {source} > #$i [pipe1|pipe2|...]
# Same as Interval grouping with $j := $i+1. (Except if $j == '-0' then $i == '-0' as well.) (This has use cases, I swear)
#   >>> [alpha|beta|gamma|delta] > #2 convert fullwidth
# Output: alpha
#         beta
#         ÔΩáÔΩÅÔΩçÔΩçÔΩÅ
#         delta
